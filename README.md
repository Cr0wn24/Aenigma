# Aenigma

A small prototype game I created as a side project. It is a single-threaded SIMD software rasterized isometric 2D game written in pure C with no libraries. It was showcased on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC464dQ0y73kLfS9Kxm6cztQ

## Build and run

1. Run `build.bat` in the source directory with visual studio environment variables enabled.
2. A folder `build` has now been created in the root folder. Run the .exe
